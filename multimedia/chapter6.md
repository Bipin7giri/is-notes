### 1. **What is sound? Differentiate between sound and audio.**

**Sound** is a vibration that propagates as an acoustic wave, through a medium such as air or water, that is perceptible by the human ear. It consists of pressure waves caused by vibrating objects.

**Audio**, on the other hand, refers to sound that has been captured, recorded, or transmitted electronically, often in a format suitable for storage or playback.

- **Sound**: Natural phenomenon, created by vibrations.
- **Audio**: Electronic representation of sound.

### 2. **Define audio file and calculate the file size in bytes for a 30-second recording at 44.1 kHz, 8 bits resolution stereo sound.**

An **audio file** is a digital file that stores sound data, typically in formats like MP3, WAV, or AAC. It is characterized by sample rate, bit depth, and number of channels (mono, stereo).

For a 30-second recording at 44.1 kHz, 8-bit resolution stereo sound:
- **Sample rate** = 44.1 kHz (44,100 samples per second)
- **Bit depth** = 8 bits (1 byte)
- **Stereo** = 2 channels

\[
\text{File Size} = \text{Sample Rate} \times \text{Bit Depth} \times \text{Channels} \times \text{Duration}
\]
\[
\text{File Size} = 44,100 \times 8 \times 2 \times 30 = 21,168,000 \, \text{bits} = 2,646,000 \, \text{bytes} \approx 2.65 \, \text{MB}

### 3. **What is MIDI? Discuss the components of a MIDI system.**

**MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface)** is a technical standard that allows musical instruments, computers, and other devices to communicate and control each other. MIDI does not transmit actual sound but rather performance data, such as which note is played, its intensity, and duration.

Components of a MIDI system:
- **MIDI Controller**: A device (such as a keyboard) that sends MIDI signals.
- **MIDI Interface**: Allows the connection of MIDI devices to a computer or other devices.
- **MIDI Sequencer**: Software or hardware used to record, play, and edit MIDI signals.
- **MIDI Sound Module**: A device that produces sound in response to MIDI messages.

### 4. **Explain briefly the fundamental characteristics of sound.**

The fundamental characteristics of sound include:
- **Frequency (Pitch)**: The number of vibrations per second, measured in Hertz (Hz). It determines how high or low a sound is.
- **Amplitude (Loudness)**: The size of the sound wave, which determines how loud a sound is.
- **Timbre**: The quality or color of the sound, distinguishing different types of sound production (e.g., a piano vs. a violin).
- **Duration**: The length of time a sound is heard.
- **Wavelength**: The physical length of one cycle of the sound wave.
- **Velocity**: The speed at which sound travels through a medium, affected by temperature and medium type.

### 5. **Illustrate and discuss the speech transmission process.**

The **speech transmission process** involves converting speech into an electrical or digital signal, transmitting it over a medium, and converting it back into sound at the receiver's end. The steps include:
- **Speech Encoding**: Analog-to-digital conversion of spoken words into a stream of binary data.
- **Transmission**: Sending the encoded signal over a network (e.g., VoIP, telephony).
- **Reception and Decoding**: The receiver decodes the digital signal back into an analog signal to reproduce the original speech.

### 6. **What is audio compression? Explain lossy audio compression with an example.**

**Audio compression** reduces the size of audio files by eliminating redundant or less important sound information.

- **Lossy Compression**: Reduces file size by discarding parts of the sound that are less noticeable to the human ear, resulting in some loss of quality. A common example is **MP3**. For instance, compressing a WAV file into MP3 reduces the file size but also removes certain frequencies that are inaudible or less important.

### 7. **What is speech generation? Illustrate the speech transmission process.**

**Speech generation** is the process of converting text or abstract data into human speech. This process involves:
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: A system that converts written text into audible speech using linguistic algorithms and voice synthesis techniques.
- **Phonetic Conversion**: Breaking the text into phonemes, the basic sounds of speech.
- **Prosody Generation**: Adding rhythm, stress, and intonation to make the speech sound natural.
  
The **speech transmission process** was described earlier (Q5), involving encoding, transmission, and decoding of speech data.

### 8. **Discuss the types of digital audio file formats.**

Common **digital audio file formats** include:
- **WAV**: Uncompressed audio format with high-quality sound, commonly used for professional recording.
- **MP3**: Compressed, lossy format popular for music due to its smaller file size.
- **FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec)**: A lossless format that compresses audio without losing any quality.
- **AAC (Advanced Audio Coding)**: A lossy format, often used in streaming and digital broadcasting due to its high efficiency.
- **OGG**: A lossy format, commonly used in open-source applications.

### 9. **Identify speech analysis and draw the figure of research analysis of speech.**

**Speech analysis** refers to the study of the linguistic and acoustic characteristics of speech. It involves:
- **Acoustic Analysis**: Examining the physical sound properties, like frequency and amplitude.
- **Phonetic Analysis**: Understanding the individual sounds (phonemes) used in speech.
- **Linguistic Analysis**: Studying the structure and meaning behind spoken words.

Unfortunately, I cannot draw figures directly. However, a typical **speech research analysis diagram** might involve:
1. **Input Speech Signal**: Captured from a speaker.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Breaking down the speech signal into measurable features like pitch, formants, and spectral data.
3. **Classification**: Analyzing patterns in the speech features to understand content or emotions.
4. **Output**: Results in insights like word recognition, speaker identification, or emotional state.
