**1. What is a digital image? Discuss the basic elements of a digital image.**

- **Digital Image**: A digital image is a representation of a two-dimensional image using binary (0s and 1s). It is made up of a grid of small square elements called *pixels*, where each pixel represents the color or intensity of the image at that point.
  
- **Basic Elements of a Digital Image**:
  - **Pixels**: The smallest unit of a digital image, which holds information about brightness (in grayscale) or color (in color images).
  - **Resolution**: The number of pixels in an image, typically measured in width × height (e.g., 1920 × 1080).
  - **Bit Depth**: The number of bits used to represent the color of a single pixel. More bits mean more colors can be displayed.
  - **Color Model**: Defines how colors are represented (e.g., RGB for color images, Grayscale for black and white).

**2. Define image processing. Also, write the advantages and disadvantages of digital image processing.**

- **Image Processing**: Image processing involves manipulating a digital image using algorithms to enhance it, analyze information, or extract features. It includes tasks like improving image quality, object recognition, and image transformation.

- **Advantages**:
  - **Improved Quality**: Enhances image features, removes noise, and adjusts colors.
  - **Automation**: Many processes, such as object detection and recognition, can be automated.
  - **Versatility**: Digital images can be easily shared, edited, and stored in various formats.
  
- **Disadvantages**:
  - **High Computational Cost**: Processing large images or video requires high processing power.
  - **Data Loss**: Certain techniques (like compression) may result in loss of detail.
  - **Privacy Concerns**: With advanced recognition and tracking, there can be ethical issues related to privacy.

**3. Explain the components of an image processing system with illustration.**

- **Components**:
  1. **Image Acquisition**: Capturing or obtaining the image (using a camera or scanner).
  2. **Image Preprocessing**: Improving the quality of the image by removing noise or adjusting brightness/contrast.
  3. **Segmentation**: Dividing the image into its constituent parts or objects.
  4. **Feature Extraction**: Extracting important information or characteristics from the image (like edges, textures, shapes).
  5. **Image Recognition**: Identifying and interpreting objects in the image.
  6. **Image Output**: Displaying or storing the processed image.

Each of these components works together to manipulate and analyze digital images.

**4. Compare and contrast between image and graphics.**

- **Image**:
  - **Nature**: A digital photograph or a representation of the real world.
  - **Structure**: Comprised of pixels (raster data).
  - **Types**: Photographs, scanned documents, etc.
  - **Usage**: Used for realistic representations like photos, medical images, etc.

- **Graphics**:
  - **Nature**: Drawn objects, symbols, or diagrams created manually or using software.
  - **Structure**: Can be raster (pixel-based) or vector (geometrical shapes).
  - **Types**: Logos, illustrations, charts, etc.
  - **Usage**: Often used for visual communication, such as designs or technical drawings.

**5. What is computer graphics? Differentiate between raster graphics and vector graphics.**

- **Computer Graphics**: The art of using computers to generate visual content, including the creation, manipulation, and representation of images, animations, and videos.

- **Raster Graphics**:
  - Composed of pixels.
  - Lose quality when scaled (e.g., JPEG, PNG).
  - Used for detailed images like photographs.

- **Vector Graphics**:
  - Made from paths or geometrical shapes (points, lines, curves).
  - Scale without losing quality (e.g., SVG, AI).
  - Used for logos, icons, and illustrations.

**6. Describe the various types of image and graphics formats.**

- **Image Formats**:
  - **JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)**: Compressed, used for photographs.
  - **PNG (Portable Network Graphics)**: Lossless compression, supports transparency.
  - **GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)**: Supports animations, uses limited color palette.
  - **TIFF (Tagged Image File Format)**: High-quality images, often used for printing.

- **Graphics Formats**:
  - **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)**: Vector-based, used for scalable designs like icons.
  - **PDF (Portable Document Format)**: Can include both vector and raster elements, widely used for documents.
  - **EPS (Encapsulated PostScript)**: Used for vector illustrations in high-resolution printing.

**7. Discuss the image synthesis process.**

- **Image Synthesis**: The process of generating a new image using computational methods. It involves the creation of realistic or abstract images from models, algorithms, or data. Techniques include:
  - **Rendering**: Converting 3D models into 2D images.
  - **Ray Tracing**: Simulating light rays to produce highly realistic images.
  - **Procedural Generation**: Using algorithms to automatically generate textures, landscapes, or objects.

**8. What is image recognition? Explain with a figure about the steps of image recognition.**

- **Image Recognition**: The process by which a system identifies objects, people, text, or other information within an image. It is widely used in facial recognition, object detection, and text recognition.

- **Steps**:
  1. **Image Preprocessing**: Improving the quality of the image by filtering, resizing, or enhancing.
  2. **Feature Extraction**: Identifying key characteristics in the image (edges, corners, textures).
  3. **Classification**: Using machine learning or deep learning models to categorize objects within the image.
  4. **Post-processing**: Refining the output and displaying the results.

*(To include a figure, you could draw a diagram with these steps connecting in a sequence.)*

**9. What are the different forms of image transmission? Explain.**

- **Forms of Image Transmission**:
  1. **Analog Transmission**: Transmission of images using analog signals, such as in traditional television broadcasting.
  2. **Digital Transmission**: Sending images as data over networks (e.g., the internet, mobile networks) using formats like JPEG, PNG.
  3. **Wireless Transmission**: Transmitting images wirelessly over Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or mobile networks.
  4. **Satellite Transmission**: Sending images from satellites to Earth for weather forecasting, mapping, and surveillance.
